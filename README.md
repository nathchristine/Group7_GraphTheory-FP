# ‚ãÜÔΩ°‚ÄßÀö öüóëÔ∏è…ûÀö‚ÄßÔΩ°‚ãÜ Optimizing Waste Management Disposal In Tokyo Trough Graph Theory Application

# Introduction
Optimizing waste management in Tokyo using graph theory offers a promising approach to improving the efficiency of the city's complex waste disposal system. Given the historical context of Japan's waste management challenges, particularly with its limited land space and growing urban population, Tokyo has adopted a sophisticated system that integrates waste collection, transportation, recycling, and disposal. 

The traditional Japanese philosophy of Mottainai which emphasizes minimizing waste and maximizing the utility of resources has also influenced the development of waste management strategies, such as heat recovery and resource recycling.

# DataSet
In collecting the dataset, we prioritised finding relevant and reliable resources. Once identified, we then used Google Maps to determine the longitude and latitude of each location. 

## Data for Chinese Postman Problem (CPP)

The dataset required for the CPP Algorithm includes the area name in which the garbage collection edge is located, accompanied by the city name that the area is in and its respective longitude and latitude points. The data acquired has been obtained from the Gomi-Map Application; A Japan-based app that uses data and technology to promote sustainability. It helps users find nearby recycling spots and the best routes to navigate towards the recycling spot. 


## Data for Dijkstra

The dataset required for the Dijkstra Algorithm includes the various types of incineration plants located in Tokyo. To accommodate the algorithm‚Äôs need for searching the closest incineration plant depending on the specific type of incineration plant needed to travel to, we have attained information based on the Waste Report 2023 by the Clean Authority of Tokyo and categorized the locations to mainly two primary types: one for combustible materials, and another for incombustible materials. Additionally, for cases involving recycling, we‚Äôve added information based on a report made by ShinMaywa Industries, Ltd. to ensure that the dataset is able to include relevant recycling centers as alternative destinations.
